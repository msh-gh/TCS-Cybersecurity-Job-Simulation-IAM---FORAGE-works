Tata Cybersecurity Security Analyst Job Simulation on Forage - May 2025
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Completed a job simulation involving identity and access management (IAM) for
   Tata Consultancy Services, collaborating with a Cybersecurity Consulting
   team.
 * Acquired expertise in IAM principles, cybersecurity best practices, and
   strategic alignment with business objectives.
 * Delivered comprehensive documentation and presentations, showcasing the
   ability to communicate complex technical concepts effectively.


I recently participated in Tata Consultancy Services' job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on a Cybersecurity Consulting team at Tata Consultancy Services. I worked on a project to enhance identity and access management strategies. I practised using industry-standard IAM tools and built my cybersecurity skills in a real-world context. Doing this programme confirmed that I really enjoy working on cybersecurity challenges, and I'm excited to apply these skills on a Cybersecurity Consulting team at a company like Tata Consultancy Services
